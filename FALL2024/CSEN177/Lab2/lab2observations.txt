Step 3:
Segmentation Fault

Step 4:
3000 ms delay
Child Process and Parent Process took turns running, child process was quicker, seeing as
the parent process had 9 instances to run through after the child process reached 99.
500 ms delay
Same occurence, the Child Process would run back to back before the Parent got the chance,
and the Parent process had 9 instances to run after the child process finished
5000 ms delay
Same thing.

Step 5:
Hard to figure out the logic
Nested If statements got messy
I had to figure out why Parent pids of 1 were showing up (I needed an equal amount of 
wait (NULL)'s for each child)

Step 6:
Pretty simple, compiled and ran without many issues
Ran correctly as well, seeing as neither the parent or child process ran twice inbetween
the time interval of the other function

Step 7:
Most of the code here was copied from the parts 1-4's code, so not many issues here.
