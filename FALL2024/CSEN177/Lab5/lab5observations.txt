CSEN 177 Lab 5 Observations

Part 1 (threadSync.c)
Runs as expected, Thread enters critical section, and then returns after the next thread
enters critical section

Part 2:
Implementing with pthread mutex-es was pretty easy just replacing the lines that used
semaphors. Ran as expected, outputting the same as part 1

Part 3:
Using mutex locks for consumer producer threads went as expected. Producer would produce
an integer rand() %100 and consumer would consume that integer 

Part 4:
Using mutex locks for consumer producer threads went as expected. Producer would produce
an integer rand() %100 and consumer would consume that integer. Added implementation to 
keep track of how full buffer is with a variable
